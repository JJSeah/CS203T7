3. Alogrithm to handle mutiple users looking for chargers
4. Manually book appointment to charge car 
5. Payment allowing the user to have a seamless transaction

## Building Backend 
You donâ€™t need to build from source to use Spring Boot (binaries in repo.spring.io), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Boot can be built and published to your local Maven cache using the Gradle wrapper. You also need JDK 17.

`$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`

This will build all of the jars and documentation and publish them to your local Maven cache. It wonâ€™t run any of the tests. If you want to build everything, use the build task:

`$ ./gradlew build`

## Building Frontend 
npm - start 


##  Backend Documentation 
API Documentation is available [online][api]. Built using Swagger to produce a comprehensive documentation.
